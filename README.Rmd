## Overview
The purpose of SaviR is to collect the functions needed to access and prepare various COVID data sources.

This package is divided into two main sections: analytical datasets and data visualizations.

## Installation

You can install the released version of SaviR from [Github](https://github.com/CDCGov/SaviR) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("CDCgov/SaviR")
```

### COVAD - COVID Analytical Datasets

| Metadata Functions | Get Functions      | Calculation Functions | Production Functions |
|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
| get_one_table      | get_covid_sources  | calc_add_risk         | prod_sitrep          |
| get_country_coords | get_testing        |                       |                      |

* Metadata is stored in this package and can be called:

```{r eval=FALSE}
metadata <- onetable  
country_coordinates <- country_coords  
```
