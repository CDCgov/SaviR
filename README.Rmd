## Overview
The purpose of the SaviR package is to collate data from various publicly available Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) data sources for analysis and visualization. This package is divided into two main sections: COVID Analytical Datasets (COVAD) and COVID Data Visualizations (COVIS).

### Data Sources
* [**World Health Organization (WHO)**](https://covid19.who.int/) - COVID-19 Cases and Deaths (China data includes Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macua data)  
* [**Johns Hopkins University (JHU)**](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series) - COVID-19 Cases and Deaths (China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macua data are disaggregated)   
* [**Our World In Data (OWID)**](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data) - COVID-19 Vaccines, Tests, and Hospitalizations  
* [**United Nations**](https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/) - Population Estimates

*Note: Please refer to original data sources to ensure data accuracy as data models could have changed*
